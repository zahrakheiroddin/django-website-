## Introduction

A brief introduction to your project, explaining its purpose and features.

## Project Structure

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Here is an overview of a typical Django project structure:

```
my_project/
├── my_project/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── wsgi.py
│   └── asgi.py
├── my_app/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### Explanation of Each Component

#### Project Root (`my_project/`)

- **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project. You can use it to run the server, make database migrations, and more.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the dependencies your project needs. You can install these using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### Project Directory (`my_project/my_project/`)

- **__init__.py**: An empty file that indicates to Python that this directory should be considered a package.
- **settings.py**: The configuration file for your project. Here you define settings like database configuration, installed apps, middleware, and more.
- **urls.py**: The URL configuration file. This file routes incoming web requests to the appropriate view functions.
- **wsgi.py**: The Web Server Gateway Interface configuration file. It helps Django communicate with the web server.
- **asgi.py**: The Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface configuration file. It helps Django handle asynchronous web requests.

#### Application Directory (`my_project/my_app/`)

- **migrations/**: A directory where Django stores database migration files. These files keep track of changes to your models over time.
- **__init__.py**: An empty file that indicates to Python that this directory should be considered a package.
- **admin.py**: A configuration file for the Django admin interface. Here you can register models to be managed through the admin panel.
- **apps.py**: A configuration file for your application. It defines the configuration for your app and some metadata.
- **models.py**: A file where you define your database models. Each model maps to a single table in the database.
- **tests.py**: A file where you write tests for your application. Testing ensures your code works as expected.
- **views.py**: A file where you define view functions. Views handle web requests and return web responses, typically rendering HTML templates.
